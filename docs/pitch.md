# Pitch

### Problem
There are currently ~2000 validators on the Testnet, and the majority of these are set up using variegated guides and information available on the Internet: these are ad-hoc, unique installations with varying software versions, configurations, and user profiles.
As a result, each of the validator nodes has its own, unique problems; the nodes are hard to configure for those running them, and it's difficult for the Solana community to provide any help or support. There is a lack of monitoring and alerting tools, too, and the means of issue analysis are insuffient.
Also, certain percentage of people give up after facing the challenge of figuring it out on their own.
The outcome:
* Overall cluster efficiency is lower than it could be
* High entry barrier slows down network decentralization

### Solution
A validator node management toolkit + a team to help the community with setting up and running their validator nodes.
* A software toolkit to set up and monitor a Solana validator node, including useful alerts and notifications to help you bootstrap and run your node in the most efficient way.
Features:
1) Node bootstrapping
2) Node monitoring
3) Disaster recovery
4) Alerts (via Telegram bot and other channels)
5) Mobile cockpit for alerts, notifications, and node control on the go
6) Advanced node monitoring
7) Advanced cluster monitoring
8) Big Data: collect, offer access via an open API, analyze, convert to Smart Data (multiple uses, e.g. improve stake bot functionality by leveraging validator metrics; identify correlations between metrics within the dynamic system of a cluster) 

For Solana newcomers, it's a one-click solution to quickly set up the node and monitor it.
For Linux experts, it's a set of useful Ansible scripts to use as references and best practice documents.

With _SV Manager_, we have an MVP where features 1) and 2) have been implemented. With your support, we now aim to implement the rest of the above list, and more.

* The team: we support both the _SV Manager_ project (including toolkit, monitoring dashboard, and various further additional tools) and members of the Solana community who are using the toolkit – by providing technical support, made possible by the consistent nature of all installations performed using SV Manager.

### Impact for the Solana network:
* Increased network decentralization through a lowered barrier to entry: the toolkit enables a much larger audience to set up and run a validator node
* Higher efficiency and resiliency of then network

Amount of funding
Depending on the available funding, we would be able to dedicate varying amount of our time to the project.
We are willing to invest up to X hours per week each, at rates of Y EUR/hour (Z% below our normal working rates).
Better funding means we would be able to achieve more of the goals listed above and do it faster, while also offering more support for the Solana Validator community.
