# Pitch

### The problem
There are currently ~3000 validators on the Testnet, and the majority of these are ad-hoc installations with varying software versions, configurations, user profiles, etc.
As a result, each has its own, unique problems; the nodes are hard to configure for those running them, and it's difficult to provide any help or support for the Solana community.
The outcome:
* Overall cluster efficiency is lower than it could be
* Some people give up after facing the challenge of figuring it out on their own

### Our solution
We created a toolkit and assembled a team to help the community with setting up and running their validator nodes.
* The tool – _SV Manager_: a software toolkit to set up and monitor a Solana validator node, including useful alerts and notifications to help you bootstrap and run your node in the most efficient way.
Features already implemented:
** Bootstrap the node
** Monitor the node
Planned additional features:
** Disaster recovery
** Alerts (via Telegram bot and other channels)
** Mobile app for alerts, notifications, and node control on the go
** Advanced node monitoring
** Advanced cluster monitoring
** Open API for all data (for example, can be used by stake bots to select a validator)

For Solana newcomers, it's an easy way to quickly set up the node and monitor it.
For Linux experts, it's a set of useful Ansible scripts to use as references and best practice documents.

* The team: we support both the SV Manager project (including toolkit, monitoring dashboard, and various further additional tools) and members of the Solana community who are using the toolkit – by providing technical support, made possible by the consistent nature of all installations performed using SV Manager.

### Impact for the Solana network:
* Lowered barrier to entry: the toolkit enables a much larger audience to set up and run a validator node, thus increasing the network's decentralization
* Higher efficiency and dependability of then network
